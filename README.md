# What is Kawa?

Kawa is a lightweight HTTP client for python üêç, built in Rust! ü¶Ä

# Goals

Kawa aims to be a small HTTP client with a fairly sized feature set, with good performance and speed. Kawa does not aim to be a replacement for `requests`. Kawa simply will implement the HTTP protocol for you and allow you to send HTTP messages, however will not perform any convenience functions, such as serializing `json` data for you. This will need to be done by you.



## Features

- [x] HTTP support
- [ ] HTTPS support
- [ ] WebSocket support
